"""Cloud VLM parser: a rendered page image -> markdown via an OpenRouter model.

Used by remediation to re-parse visual / low-recall pages from their image. The
model is a `Wikify Settings` value (`vlm_model`) so it's switchable without code.

Ported from the POC `parsers/vlm_parser.py`. The page is already rendered upstream
(`pdf_utils.render_png` -> data URL), so this takes the data URL directly — no
on-demand re-render, no `image_to_data_url` disk round-trip.
