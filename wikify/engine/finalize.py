"""Document-level finalize pass — persist furniture removal into canonical markdown.

The per-page `cleanup` / VLM remediation makes each page good in isolation, but running
page furniture (the repeated document-title banner, the doc-code / version / date line,
the prepared-by / approved-by sign-off footer) survives in each page's canonical
markdown. The deterministic boilerplate stripper (`loader.cleanup.clean_pages`) already
removes it — but only transiently, at sectionize time, to build the section tree; the
stored `canonical_markdown` (what the review split-pane shows) keeps the furniture.

Boilerplate detection is **document-global** (it needs every page to see what recurs),
so it belongs in a whole-document pass, not the per-page remediation. This pass runs
`clean_pages` over the doc and writes the stripped result back to each page's canonical
markdown, so the review view matches what the sections / wiki already get. It is purely
deterministic — no LLM, no PDF re-render (`pdf_path` is only the section rebuild's
embedded-ToC level map, mirroring `remediate_pdf`).

Cross-page table merging was considered here too, but on real manuals the deterministic
`stitch_cross_page_tables` (in remediation) already handles the clean cases and genuine
splits are rare — so it's deferred until a corpus actually needs it.
