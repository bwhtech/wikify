"""Remediation pass — ported from the POC `pipeline.remediate_document`.

Every target page gets the **vlm** (image) re-parse — 0.4 slice 22 removed the
recall-gated routing, so a subtly mangled table on a "good enough" page can't dodge the
pass. Text pages additionally get the cheap **cleanup** (text model) variant, so
adoption picks best-of-three {baseline, cleanup, vlm}:
  - cleanup is adopt-eligible when it preserves content (recall within tolerance — a
    small drop is the intended furniture removal);
  - vlm is adopt-eligible when it beats the baseline composite;
  - vlm wins over an eligible cleanup only when it also scores at least as high.
Always-run ≠ always-adopt. The adopted (or baseline) markdown becomes each page's
**canonical** markdown; cross-page tables are then stitched, the doc's canonical mean is
recomputed, and per-page LLM spend lands on `Source Page.llm_cost` /
`Source Document.llm_cost`.

I/O-boundary changes vs the POC: persistence goes through `store` (the Frappe ORM seam)
instead of `loader/graph`; pages are re-rendered from the PDF via `pdf_utils` instead of
read off disk. The routing + adoption rules are unchanged. **Sequential** (not the POC's
ThreadPoolExecutor) — the Frappe ORM writes are not thread-safe; a dev-tool remediate
over a manual is fast enough serial.
