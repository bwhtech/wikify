"""Cheap text-only markdown cleanup.

When the baseline extractor produced all the text but mangled the structure
(picture-omitted wrappers, broken tables, <br> blobs), a cheap text model can
restructure it WITHOUT the page image. It must not change the actual content —
the caller re-scores recall as a guard.

Ported from the POC `loader/cleanup_llm.py`. I/O-boundary change only: the call goes
through `engine.llm` (REST) and the model id comes from `engine.settings`.

	"- Remove running page furniture (headers/footers): the repeated document-title banner, "
	"the document-code / version / issue / date line, 'Page X of Y', and the "
	"prepared-by / issued-by / approved-by footer block. Keep only the page's substantive content.\n"
	"- Restore real Markdown structure: headings (#/##/###), numbered and bulleted lists, "
	"and proper Markdown tables (only when the content is genuinely tabular).\n"
	"- Headings must be plain text: strip bold/italic emphasis from heading lines "
	"(e.g. `## _**Verbal Orders**_` → `## Verbal Orders`); never wrap a heading in * or _.\n"
	"- Keep ALL substantive text. Do NOT summarize, add, translate, or drop real content.\n"
