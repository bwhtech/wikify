"""Wiki-generation helpers ported from the POC `loader/wiki.py`.

Only the *pure* pieces live here — slug derivation and the page-reference rewrite
regex — so they stay verbatim against the POC and unit-testable without Frappe. The
orchestration (creating Wiki Documents, resolving page N → a section's route) lives in
`engine/generate.py`, which injects the resolver into `rewrite_page_refs`.

The source PDFs cross-reference by **page number** ("refer Page No. 130", "see page
42"); a wiki has no page numbers, only links. After every Wiki Document exists (so
targets resolve), pass 2 rewrites internal page refs into wiki links. External book
citations ("Williams p820") are deliberately left as text — only refs with a see/refer
cue or the "Page No. N" form (and `N <= page_count`) are treated as internal.
