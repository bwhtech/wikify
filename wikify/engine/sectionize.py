"""Sectionize pass (Slice 4) — build a doc's Source Section tree from its pages.

Ported from the POC `pipeline._store_sections`: take each page's canonical markdown,
strip cross-page boilerplate (running headers/footers that would read as fake
headings), split into hierarchical sections honoring the embedded PDF outline, and
rebuild the `Source Section` NestedSet tree.

Run at the end of both parse (canonical == baseline there) and remediate (canonical ==
adopted output), so the tree always reflects the best available markdown — the
remediate rebuild never reverts to empty/pre-cleanup text.
