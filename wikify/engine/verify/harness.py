"""POC-0 scoring engine: combine deterministic + judge into a PageScore.

Scoring is page-type aware. TEXT pages use recall/extra/table/judge. VISUAL pages
(diagrams/flowcharts/images) have near-empty extractable text, so recall/extra are
meaningless there — the composite is judge-dominant (the judge sees the image).

Ported from the POC `verify/harness.py`. Thresholds come from `engine.settings`
(user-tunable); the composite weights stay code-side in `engine.config`; the judge
receives the page image as a data URL.
