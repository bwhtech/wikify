"""Single-page re-parse (0.2 Slice 14) — the agent's instruction-steered page tools.

Where the remediate pass (`remediate.py`) routes + re-scores *every* target page, these
helpers act on **one** page so the agent can fix a single mis-parsed page on the user's
plain-English instruction ("keep the table as a real markdown table", "don't make this a
mermaid diagram"). Two entry points:

  - `reparse_page` — re-run cleanup/VLM on one page, steered by `instruction` (on top of
    the project context), re-score, and adopt the result as that page's **canonical**
    markdown. Reuses the same engine pieces remediate does; no full-tree rebuild (the
    page's canonical is what the Page Review shows, and a single targeted edit must not
    blow away manual tree structure — the user re-runs reclassify/remediate to propagate).
  - `embed_page_image` — **deterministic, no LLM**: replace a page's canonical markdown
    with an embed of its already-rendered image. The literal "just paste the image of the
    PDF page" request.
